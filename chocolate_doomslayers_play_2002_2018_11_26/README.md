Description             : Fans of the Doom port, Chocolate Doom, played some
                          of the Doom mod "2002 A DOOM ODYSSEY", with a lot
						  of lag!
                          
                          This demo was recorded using CD version 3.0.0
                          https://github.com/chocolate-doom/chocolate-doom/releases/tag/chocolate-doom-3.0.0
                          
                          Demos were set up on the Chocolate Doom Discord
                          server. The players in the demo are Owly,
						  Mortrixs, and Technochips.
                          
                          While playing this mod, all of the players
                          suffered from bad lag, so that's why in many of the
                          demos, a player will try, and fail to grab an
                          object that is right in front of them.
                          
                          The server used was ChocDoom 3.0, if you are
                          interested in Doom or Chocolate Doom, please join
                          the Discord server; https://discord.gg/5M8K6vQ
                          
                          To find more Chocolate Doom master servers, check

Additional Credits to   : The devs of Chocolate Doom, most noticeably Simon
                          Howard (Fraggle), and Fabian Greffrath, who without
                          them, this demo, and a lot of Doom preservation,
                          would not be possible.
                          
                          Cheers, guys!
