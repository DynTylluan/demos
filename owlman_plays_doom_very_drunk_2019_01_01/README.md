Description             : After a new year's party, Owly got *very* drunk,
                          and decided to record a demo for some reason of her
                          speedrunning Doom's E1 maps. Enjoy.

Additional Credits to   : The devs of Chocolate Doom, most noticeably Simon
                          Howard (Fraggle), and Fabian Greffrath, who without
                          them, this demo, and a lot of Doom preservation,
                          would not be possible.
                          
                          Along with this, a big thank you to
